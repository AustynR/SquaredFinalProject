                My name is Austyn Rowan and I created Squared so people
                like me could learn more about chess. I am 18 years old.
                I am a senior in high school and will be graduating in May 2023.
                I have many hobbies, but chess is one of my favorites. I love to
                spend my free time playing chess. I hope that with this website I
                will be able to introduce the game of chess to more people and teach
                them basic knowledge that they need to know if they want to start playing.

                I started to play chess in august of 2021 and introduced my friends to it as well. Initially I had lost
                a lot of rating points playing against my friends because we did not know how to play, but as I
                continued
                to play, I got better. It was not until this last year that my rating started to go up. I reached a peak
                rating of 744 on January 17, 2023, which was about a week ago at the time of writing this (I am
                currently rated 682 in rapid, rapid means 10 minutes on the clock per player). It wasnâ€™t until recently
                that I started playing the puzzle mode on chess.com and I have learned a lot just by playing that. I
                reached my peak puzzle rating of 1515 on January 16, 2023, and I am currently rated 1296. The main
                reason I am losing so many points recently is because I am trying new things that I previously knew
                nothing about. The thing with chess is that their will always be something new you can learn.
